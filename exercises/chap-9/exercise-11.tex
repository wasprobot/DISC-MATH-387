\Que{
    Determine the explicit formula
    for $t_n$, the fewest moves in which
    you can solve the problem of
    \textbf{Towers of Hanoi}.
}
\Ans{
    Let $p_1, p_2, p_3$ be the three pegs and
    $t_n$ be the number of minimum moves 
    required to move $n$ disks ($d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n$)
    from peg $p_1$ to $p_3$,
    using $p_2$ as an intermediary. \\

    To accomplish this, we first move $n-1$ disks
    from $p1$ to $p_2$, using $p_3$ 
    as an intermediary ($t_{n-1}$ moves);
    move the largest disk ($d_n$) from
    $p_1$ to $p_3$ ($1$ move); and finally
    move the $n-1$ disks from $p_2$ to $p_3$,
    using $p_1$ as an intermediary ($t_{n-1}$ moves).
    Hence we see that $t_n = 2t_{n-1} + 1, t_1=1$.
    On simplifying:

    \begin{equation}
        t_n-2t_{n-1}=1
    \end{equation}

    This is a non-homogeneous equation
    which can be written as an 
    \textit{advancement operator equation}
    $(A-2)f = 1, f(1)=1$.
    For the homogenous part
    $(A-2)f=0$ or $Af = 2f$, the solution would be a function
    whose terms double with each progression, we can
    say that $f_1(n)=c_1{2^n}$ is a solution. \\

    For the non-homogeneous part
    let $c_2$ be a \textit{particular solution} to
    the equation. On trying it out in the equation,
    $c_2-2c_2=1$ we get $c_2=-1$.
    Therefore the solution
    to the original equation is:
    $t_n=c_12^n-1$.
    However using the initial condition,
    $t_1=1$, we have $2c_1-1=1$ or $c_1=1$.\\

    Hence the explicit formula that we desire is
    \boxed{t_n = 2^n-1}.
