\begin{thm}
Suppose that in a gossiping village of $n$ people, 
every resident knows exactly one rumor. Any resident can call another one over the phone,
at which point they can share every rumor they know. 
Show that if $n$ is at least $4$, then $2n-4$ phone calls is sufficient to achieve 
that every resident knows every rumor.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
By induction on $n$, the number of people.
\basis
Let $C_n$ denote the number of calls required to achieve the goal.
For $n=4$, the 4 people ($p_1,p_2,p_3, p_4$) 
will need to make the following calls (in this order):

$p_{1,2}$ results in $p_1 = (1,2)$ and $p_2 = (1,2)$

$p_{3,4}$ results in $p_3 = (3,4)$ and $p_4 = (3,4)$        

$p_{2,3}$ results in $p_2 = (1,2,3,4)$ and $p_3 = (1,2,3,4)$        

$p_{1,4}$ results in $p_1 = (1,2,3,4)$ and $p_4 = (1,2,3,4)$        

Therefore, $C_4=4$
\ih
For $n$ people, the number of calls require to achieve the goal:
\begin{equation}
C_n = 2n-4
\end{equation}
\is
For $n+1$ people, one person, say $p_x$ calls another,
say $p_y$ to tell their rumor. This is one call:
\begin{equation}
    C_{x,y} = 1
\end{equation}
The remaining $n$ people (excluding $p_x$) can learn all their rumor 
and that of $p_x$'s in $2n-4$ calls (induction hypothesis):
\begin{equation}
    C_{n} = 2n-4
\end{equation}
Now $p_x$ gets "caught up" with the everybody else 
by calling $p_y$ again. This will be one more call:
\begin{equation}
    C_{x,y} = 1
\end{equation}
Adding the equations (2), (3) and (4),
the total calls for $n+1$ people:
\begin{equation}
    C_{n+1} = 2n-4+1+1 = 2n+2-4 = 2(n+1) - 4
\end{equation}

The truth of the proposition for a specific $n$ implies
truth for $n+1$. Hence the proposition must be true for
all $n>4$.
