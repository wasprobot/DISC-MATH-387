\Que{
  Alice and Bob are discussing a graph that has 
  $17$ vertices and $129$ edges. 
  Bob argues that the graph is Hamiltonian, 
  while Alice says that he's wrong. 
  Without knowing anything more about the graph, 
  must one of them be right? If so, who and why, 
  and if not, why not?
}
\Ans{
  Without knowing if the graph is connected 
  it is hard to say if the graph is Hamiltonian.
