  Eulerian algorithm:\\

  1) Starting with $(1)$, visit every connected vertex, 
  in the ascending order of ordinal until you reach $(1)$: \\

  $\textcolor{blue}{(1,4,8,3,2,7,12,2,9,3,5,6,1)}$\\

  \begin{tikzpicture}[shorten >=1pt,->]

  2) If there are still unvisited edges,
  break the circuit at the lowest vertex incident with
  an unvisited edge: in this case, $(2)$ 
  and find a circuit using step $1)$ 
  back to this new starting point $(2)$: \\

  \begin{tikzpicture}[shorten >=1pt,->]
    \tikzstyle{vertex}=[circle,fill=black!25,minimum size=12pt,inner sep=2pt]
    \tikzstyle{redo vertex}=[circle,fill=red!25,minimum size=12pt,inner sep=2pt]
    \node[vertex] (G_1) at (0,0) {1};
    \node[vertex] (G_6) at (1,1) {6};
    \node[vertex] (G_5) at (2,-1) {5};
    \node[vertex] (G_3) at (3,-0.5) {3};
    \node[vertex] (G_8) at (2.5,0.5) {8};

    \node[redo vertex] (G_2) at (5,-0.5) {2};
    \node[vertex] (G_7) at (7,-0.5) {7};
    \node[vertex] (G_12) at (6.5,0.5) {12};

    \draw [blue, very thick] (G_3) -- (G_9) -- cycle;
    \draw [blue, very thick] (G_3) -- (G_2) -- cycle;

    \draw [blue, very thick] (G_2) -- (G_7) -- cycle;
    \draw [blue, very thick] (G_2) -- (G_12) -- cycle;
    \draw [blue, very thick] (G_7) -- (G_12) -- cycle;
  \end{tikzpicture}\\

  The first circuit, broken at $(2)$:\\

  $\textcolor{blue}{(1,4,8,3,2,7,12,2,\textcolor{red}{\dots},2,9,3,5,6,1)}$\\
  
  The new circuit starting at $(2)$:\\

  $\textcolor{red}{(2,10,9,4,11,2)}$\\

  The two circuits, merged:\\

  $(1,4,8,3,2,7,12,\textcolor{red}{2,10,9,4,11,2},9,3,5,6,1)$\\

  Since there aren't any unvisited edges, we have the \textit{Eulerian Circuit}.
